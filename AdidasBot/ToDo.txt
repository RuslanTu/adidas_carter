Create a tool that uses http requests to sit on a website and refresh every x seconds, 
must keep the cookies so each refresh is like refreshing a tab on a browser and 
not creating a new session or something. It must look for the site key on the site 
(data-sitekey=) once its find that it must assign the sitekey to the bot and assign all 
cookies/user-agent/proxy used to the post request so that all tasks that are started 
after will use them cookies to bypass the splash page and add straight to cart. 

GUI for splash tool - mass import proxies via text file 
(IP:port and IP:port:username:password format), option to type in number of threads/refresh time,
place that shows a count of how many proxies you entered, place to input link of 
website to refresh on. Once a proxy passes the splash page and finds the sitekey and 
cookies etc somewhere a button or something has to appear for the user to click once 
clicked it will assign sitekey/proxy/cookies etc to the bot and proxy to all 
current tasks made and future tasks made. Must also be a button to remove all 
cookies/proxy from going to newly created tasks etc back to how the bot was normally before.

Must be a 10 minute timer somewhere next to the button (expiry time of specific cook is 10mins)

Must be multiply buttons as multiple can pass within a time frame
